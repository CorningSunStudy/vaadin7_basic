# About

Vaadin Hello World

# Use by Eclipse
To use the built in server adapters of Eclipse, instead of doing "Run As -> Maven Build..." you can do
- Run As -> Run on Server
- Select the server you want to run on, e.g. Apache Tomcat 8 and click ok
- *Do not use the suggested J2EE Preview server* as it is outdated, deprecated and does not support Servlet 3, which is required for this application
